🏡 House Price Prediction - Linear Regression Solution

This repository contains my solution for the House Prices Prediction assignment, where I implemented a Linear Regression Model using Python and machine learning libraries like pandas and scikit-learn.

📌 Project Overview

Dataset: House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

Goal: Predict house prices using Linear Regression

Preprocessing: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection

Modeling: Implemented with scikit-learn

Evaluation: Used RMSE to assess performance
